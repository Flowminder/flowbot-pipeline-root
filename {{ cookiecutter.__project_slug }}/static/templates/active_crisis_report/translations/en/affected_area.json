Through this project, Flowminder will enable access to, and use of reliable and user-friendly information by humanitarian organisations for disaster preparedness and response, while strengthening its CDR processing and analysis software, FlowKit, to better support humanitarian sector data needs.</span><span class=\"f450cf\"></span><span class=\"f6be69\">Authors &amp; funders</span><span class=\"f450cf\"></span><span class=\"fa05ef\">This report was authored by the Flowminder Foundation.This work is made possible by the generous support of the American People through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
