Through this project, Flowminder will enable access to, and use of reliable and user-friendly information by humanitarian organisations for disaster preparedness and response, while strengthening its CDR processing and analysis software, FlowKit, to better support humanitarian sector data needs.<br/><br/><strong>Authors &amp; funders</strong><br/><br/>This report was authored by the Flowminder Foundation.<br/><br/>This work is made possible by the generous support of the American People through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
